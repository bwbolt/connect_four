#### About
"Connect Four...is a two-player connection board game, in which the players
choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column,
six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the
lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the
first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own
tokens.

Connect Four is a two-player game with perfect information for both sides,
meaning that nothing is hidden from anyone. Connect Four also belongs to the
classification of an adversarial, zero-sum game, since a player's advantage is
an opponent's disadvantage.

One measure of complexity of the Connect Four game is the number of possible
games board positions. For classic Connect Four played on a 7-column-wide,
6-row-high grid, there are 4,531,985,219,092 positions[5] for all game boards
populated with 0 to 42 pieces."

#### Prowess
Whereas, many scholars and Professors believe that they are remarkably talented
at the game, so much so that they will boast publicly about their exploits, the
emergence of a recent rag-tag group of mostly unexperienced players, the most
successful of whom goes by Sage Skaff, is shaking up that old and almost defunct
orthodoxy (looking at your former champion Professor T). We shall see what the
future holds....
